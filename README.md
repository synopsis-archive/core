## Branches

For new branches, use the correct prefix:

-   Branches for new features should be called `feature/a-few-words`
-   Branches for bug fixes should be called `bug/a-few-words`
-   Branches for documentation changes should be called `docs/a-few-words`
-   Branches for refactoring should be called `refactor/a-few-words`

GitHub branch names should use kebab-case, so words should be separated by a hyphen `-`.

## Pre-commit hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run a number of checks before each commit.
These checks are also run on CI. It is strongly recommended to install pre-commit as described below to **avoid
unnecessary cleanup commits**.

### Install pre-commit

> âš  [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) has to be installed on the development machine.

Run the following commands in a terminal **inside the project directory** to install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Run test to check before commit:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The first run may take a while, as it installs all the hooks.

### Checks:

-   trailing-whitespace
-   end-of-file-fixer
-   check-yaml
-   check-added-large-files
-   dotnet-format
-   eslint
-   simon-check - checks for Simon's credentials
